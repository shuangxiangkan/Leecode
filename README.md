# Leecode


In this project, I mainly do some topics on leecode. These questions are classified by type, including 
+ array 
+ breadth first search
+ binary search
+ bit operation
+ depth first search
+ dynamic programming
+ graph
+ greedy algorithm
+ hash table
+ list
+ mathematics
+ sorting
+ stack
+ string
+ tree
+ double pointer


etc. For some more difficult algorithms, training questions will be a little more, such as dynamic programming.


There is a one-to-one correspondence between these questions and Leecode. For example, P81 corresponds to question 81 of Leecode. P16dot19 corresponds to 16.19 in the interview questions.
