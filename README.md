# Leecode


In this project, I mainly do some topics on leecode. These topics are classified by type, including 
+ array 
+ breadth first search
+ binary search
+ bit operation
+ depth first search
+ dynamic programming
+ graph
+ greedy algorithm
+ hash table
+ list
+ mathematics
+ sorting
+ stack
+ string
+ tree
+ double pointer
etc. For some more difficult algorithms, training questions will be a little more, such as dynamic programming.
